How to become a Dcoin miner
----------------
1. Become an anonymous Dcoin user.
2. Go to “Mining” – “Upgrade to miner” and follow instructions.
3. Wait until the check is completed and the Account Status: “Miner” is displayed on the main page.
4. Go to “Mining” – “Promised amounts” and add the new amount.
5. Wait until the check of the amount pledged is completed.
6. Go to “Settings” – “SMS and email notifications”, enter your information and be sure to check that the mail is delivered successfully.
7. Go to “Other” – “Commission”, click “Save”.
8. Every 2 weeks vote for currency options in “Mining” – “Voting”.
9. 2-3 times a week go to “Tasks” and check other miners and their promised amounts.
10. Be ready at any time to satisfy a request to exchange the amount you promised for the same amount of DC. The request will be found in “Mining” – “Incoming requests”, and the notification will be sent to your email. The miner, who receives cash from you, has to give you the code, and you will get DC on your account only after entering the code in “Mining” – “Incoming requests”. 

Over time, you'll see how the amount of DC increases in your promised amounts. It can be exchanged for cash (“Mining” – “Exchange for cash”) by sending a request to any miner who has the required amount pledged.
